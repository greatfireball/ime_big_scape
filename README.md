# BiG-SCAPE

BiG-SCAPE (Biosynthetic Gene Similarity Clustering and Prospecting Engine) is a Python script that calculates a distance matrix between groups of genes. In particular, BiG-SCAPE has been built with the aim of analyzing **Biosynthetic Gene Clusters**, which encode the pathways for Secondary Metabolites.

BiG-SCAPE works by predicting and comparing conserved domains found in the proteins encoded in the gene clusters.

This comparison allows to form a distance matrix that can be used to group similar BGCs automatically.
